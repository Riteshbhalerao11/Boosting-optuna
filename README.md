# Captcha Recognition using CRNN

This project demonstrates a captcha recognition system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The combination of CNN and BiLSTM proves effective in recognizing complex and distorted characters within captcha images.
